      "popupDetailsText": "My programming journey began in freshman year of high school, sparked by the Zenit competition. I started with Python, then quickly adopted C++ for its performance in competitive programming, including the Informatics Olympiad (twice succeeded in regionals, both of times very close to nationals). This honed my skills in optimization, graph theory, dynamic programming, and more. I also explored LeetCode for programming challenges.\n\nIn university, I've expanded my toolkit with Java, Go (concurrency), Haskell (functional), C (system programming), CL (Specification and Verification paradigm, Uni's special) and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP). I applied these to solve diverse problems, from competitive algorithms to practical automation scripts in excel or other tools that make life easier/better.\n\nMy GitHub: link:www.github.com/Vl4dk0 showcases some of my work."

Since then, I've actively competed in major Slovak math contests (Math olympiad, Klokan, Naboj, and more). Since 7th grade in primary school I often studied advanced topics independently, even those covered later at university. This deep engagement with math has been fundamental to my problem-solving skills and love for programming."

For example a program that would parse the online editor to a text file and integrating tools that my friends made that bruteforced their ways to find closed tableaus in seconds, then automatically reparsing it back to online editor format.\n\nThis highlights my ability to apply programming skills to solve real-world problems efficiently."
